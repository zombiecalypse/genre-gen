=========

I noted that music genres have a specific naming structure. This repo has a generator for this kind of names. So if your indie band does not know what kind of music to play - run it and find out!

Some inspiration:

* avant-garde industral
* grunge pop
* gothic electro regae
* progressive opera disco
* classical gypsy celtic new metal
* celtic industral Jpunk
* blues hip hop
* classical acid  grunge
* pagan nu punk indie grunge Jfolk
